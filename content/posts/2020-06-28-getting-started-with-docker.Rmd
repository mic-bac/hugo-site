> **TL;DR**
>
> This post is ment to be a little cheat sheet for Docker setup and usage. Docker is a great tool to containerize your software products, which makes your products portable and usable in several areas (e.g. cloud or on-premises). Additionally, it is a great playground for developers as containers can offer a secure environment to try out something new without risking to break something. Furhtermore, they scale nicely and are therefore rather ressource-efficient. Check out the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) for a more detailed overview.

This post is ment to be a little cheat sheet for Docker setup and usage. For a more general overview about Docker containers see the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) or the [Introduction to Containers and Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/) from Microsoft. Just a quick note before going into detail: please, always examine scripts downloaded from the internet before running them locally.

## Setup

Before starting the setup, you could check if you Docker is already installed and ready to use:

```
$ docker --version
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

If that works out fine, you might just want to update docker.

### The Repository

If you are on Ubuntu (like me), you need to remove old docker installations first. Therefore, use the folloging command:

```
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterwards, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

First, update the `apt` package index and install packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS:

```
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

Then add Docker's official GPG key:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

And finally, verify the key:

```
$ sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88

pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
      9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]
```

Then set up a stable repository:

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

### The Engine

Install the latest version of Docker Engine and containerd.

```
$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

You can finish and verify your installation by testing the Docker Engine by running the `hello-world` image.

```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
```

This should work out fine. If there any troubles check this [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).


I ran in an issue when I tried to start my first container. I received the following error message: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.

The solution to this problem was to add the user to the Docker user group with `$ sudo usermod -aG docker SOMEUSERNAME` (then restart your computer).


## Useful Docker commands

### Build a Container

As an example I'm building a container from the `rocker/rstudio:3.6.3` image. This means, that [rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/) provides us whith an image for RStudio including R version 3.6.3.

```
$ docker run --rm -d -v /media/path/to/local/file:/home/<your_username>/rstudio -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<your_pw> -e USER=<your_username> --name <your_container_name> rocker/rstudio:3.6.3
```

If you don't have the rocker/rstudio image yet, it's automatically pulled from docker hub.
The arguments run, --rm, -d, -v, -e and -p are used to:

- [run] start a container
- [\--rm] remove the container automatically when it is stopped (all changes are lost â€“ great to try some things out as it reduces cleaning steps)
- [-d] detach the container (container runs in background)
- [-v] bind mount a volume (e.g. a folder with data as in this example, see this [link](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Sharing-files-with-host-machine) for details)
- [-e] set the environment variables PASSWORD and USER
- [-p] publish a container's port(s) to the host (here 8787:8787)
- [\--name] give the container a name, so you don't have to use the container ID (especially useful if you have multiple containers with the same image)

More Docker run commands can be found on the official [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/).

When you run the command with your specifications the container is set up.

Now, just open your browser and go to *localhost:8787* if you are on a linux machine, otherwise try http://192.168.99.100:8787 in your browser (or follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Using-the-RStudio-image). The following side should appear in your browser window:

![](/images/rstudio-login.png)

To log in use <your_username> and <your_pw> which you entered before.

After entering your credentials you should be able to see the RStudio ui. If you added a folder to mount as volume, the folder content should be embedded as well.


### System Maintainance

> `$ docker system info`

This command gives you an overview of e.g. how many containers you have/are running/stopped/paused, how many images are available locally, or the Docker root directory.


> `$ docker system prune`

The `prune` command removes all stopped containers, dangling images, and unused networks. It will prompt a warning message about what's going to happen, so be careful with this one.

By default, the command doesn't remove unused volumes or networks to prevent losing important data. To remove all unused volumes, pass the --volumes option `$ docker system prune --volumes`. Alternatively use `$ docker volume prune`.
To remove all unused networks use `$ docker network prune`.


### Container Maintainance

> `$ docker container ls -a`

List all containers.

> `$ docker container rm <container ID>`

Remove the container with container ID <container ID> (Note: The container has to be stopped before it can be removed).

> `$ docker container prune`

Removes all stopped containers. You might want to verify which containers are not running (stopped) and therefore pruned before you run the command with`$ docker container ls -a --filter status=exited --filter status=created`.

The `prune` command allows you to remove containers based on a filter condition with the `--filter` option. With multiple `--filter` options you can use more than one filter condition.

At the time of the writing of this article, the currently supported filters are until and label. You can specify more than one filter by using multiple --filter options.

For example, the following command removes containers created more than 5 minutes ago `$ docker container prune --filter "until=5m"`.


### Image Maintainance

> `$ docker image ls -a`

List all Docker images.

> `$ docker image rm <image ID>`

Remove the image with image ID <image ID> (Note: If the image is used by an existing container removing it is not allowed).

> `$ docker image prune`

Removes dangled and unused Docker images. A dangling image is an image that is not tagged and is not used by any container.
