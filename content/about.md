Hi there, 

My name is Michael. I'm data scientist at *BILLA MERKUR Österreich* - part of [REWE International AG](https://www.rewe-group.at/en/startseite) - two of Austria's leading retail companies [BILLA](https://www.billa.at/) and [MERKUR](https://www.merkurmarkt.at/). As data scientist at BMÖ I'm part of a great team and we're eager to support our business departments in developing a data-driven culture. With the help of advanced analytics and a strong BI department, we're trying to enable others to make data-based decisions.

My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in business, economics and social sciences as well as two masters - one focusing on market and consumer research and one on marketing analytics. In addition, I was able to gain expertise in various business areas like tourism management, sales, market research, statistics, analytics, and computer science until now. In short, I'd describe myself as business centered, with a strong advanced analytics toolkit and some good technological understanding.
