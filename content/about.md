Hi there, 

My name is Michael. I'm working as data scientist at *BILLA MERKUR Österreich* (BMÖ) - part of [REWE International AG](https://www.rewe-group.at/en/startseite) - two of Austria's leading retail companies [BILLA](https://www.billa.at/) and [MERKUR](https://www.merkurmarkt.at/). As data scientist at BMÖ I'm part of a great team - eager to support our business departments in developing a data-driven culture. With the help of advanced analytics and a strong BI department, we're trying to enable others to make data-based decisions.

My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in business, economics and social sciences, topped with two masters - one focusing on market and consumer research and one on marketing analytics. In addition, I was able to gain expertise in various business areas like tourism management, sales, market research, statistics, analytics, and computer science until now. At first this seems contradicting and I’m not the best marketer or engineer in the world, but I’m a better engineer than almost all marketers and a better marketer than almost all engineers. In short, I'd describe myself as customer and business centered, with a strong advanced analytics toolkit and some good technological understanding :)
