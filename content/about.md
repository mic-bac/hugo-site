Hi there, 

My name is Michael. I'm data scientist at *BILLA MERKUR Österreich* - part of [REWE International AG](https://www.rewe-group.at/en/startseite) - two of Austria's leading retail companies [BILLA](https://www.billa.at/) and [MERKUR](https://www.merkurmarkt.at/). As data scientist at BMÖ I'm part of a great team and we're eager to support our business departments in developing a data-driven culture. With the help of advanced analytics and a strong BI department, we're trying to enable others to make data-based decisions.

With a diverse educational background including a bachelor's degree in business, economics and social sciences and two masters one focusing on market and consumer research and one on marketing analytics. Additionally, I had some excursions in business areas like tourism management, sales, market research, statistics, and analytics. Therefore, I have a very customer centric and service oriented mindset paired with a statistical and analytical set of tools I'm used to work with.
