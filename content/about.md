Hi there, 

My name is Michael. I'm data scientist at [BILLA AG](https://www.billa.at/) - part of [REWE International AG](https://www.rewe-group.at/en/startseite) - one of Austria's leading retail companies. With a diverse educational background and some excursions in business areas like tourism management, sales, business administration, marketing, market research, statistics, and analytics, I finally found my home serving my curiosity - data science.
