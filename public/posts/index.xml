<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>After building your own PC you might want to install your OS. Most will choose between Windows and a Linux distribution, but you can also have all in one with WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or both with a dual boot mode. I describe the setup for a dual boot mode on two physically separated SSDs. Most information is straight forward and easy to find on the Microsoft or e.g. Ubuntu website for setting up your OS. You might find some links in the post helpful, if you need additional information.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In my previous post I wrote about building my own PC. But, without an OS it’s not that much fun (although it might look nice with some rgbs). Therefore, I’ll focus on the OS set-up in this post.</p>
<div id="operating-system" class="section level2">
<h2>Operating System</h2>
<p>For the most users the choice is between Windows or Linux. Although, it’s not necessary to choose between them anymore due to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL 2</a>, the Windows Subsystem for Linux. It allows you to install a full functional Linux kernel in Windows 10.</p>
<p>Still, when choosing my OS I decided to setup both, Windows and Linux, in dual boot mode and on two separate physical drives. The only things you need are an USB flash drive with enough storage (or CD/DVD - check if your BIOS lets you boot from the medium of your choice), another PC/notebook, and a stable internet connection.</p>
<div id="windows" class="section level3">
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Starting with the Windows installation - this one is pretty straight forward. Download the Windows creation tool and ISO file for the latest Windows version from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/">official Microsoft website</a>. Then use the tool to create your installation media. Additionally, you’ll need a product key for your installation. You could also finish the installation without one, but you won’t be able to use all features of your installation then, therefore I’d recommend to get a product key.</p>
<p>As soon as you have your installation media ready open the boot menu, which you can access by pressing a key during boot (check your mobo manual to find out which key - often <em>F12</em> or <em>del</em>). Then choose your boot medium. If everything works as expected an installation screen should pop up. Within the next steps you’ll need to choose your installation and type in your product key.</p>
<p>For certain components it might make sense to check if the necessary drivers are installed. Additionally, if you have multiple drives you should mount them. In my case the SSD including Windows was mounted - of course. But, I had to mount my HDD and format it to NTFS to use it with Windows.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much it! Now you’re good to go :)</p>
</div>
<div id="linux" class="section level3">
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>There are many Linux distributions available. I decided to setup the latest Ubuntu Desktop version (20.04 Focal Fossa), because I think it’s great to have a large community if you run in any problems - and I like the look and feel. But, that’s just a personal preference.</p>
<p>You can find a detailed description of how to setup a bootable USB flash drive for your installation on the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download">official Ubuntu website</a>.</p>
<p>Again, you have to open the boot menu and select your Ubuntu installation medium to boot from. After a few seconds you are able to choose to either install Ubuntu or to try it. If you are not sure if you want to install it, try it first.</p>
<p>If you decide to install it click on <em>Install Ubuntu</em>. Then select your preferred keyboard layout. At step <em>Updates and other Software</em> I decided to do the <em>Normal installation</em> instead of the <em>Minimal installation</em> to have all GUI related utilities available right after the installation. I also ticked the options in <em>Other options</em> to make sure everything works as expected.</p>
<p>At the <em>Installation type</em> section, I choose <em>Something else</em> as I wanted to have my own customized partition scheme on a separate SSD. To create a partition table select the device for your installation. Then click <em>New Partition Table…</em>. Use a forward slash (/) for your mount point, then you should be good to go. You might want to add a swap partition in case you run out of RAM with data intensive applications (see <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/swap-partition/" class="uri">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/swap-partition/</a> for more details). I did not create any other partitions.</p>
<p>Finally, choose your timezone and user credentials and you’re good to go :).</p>
<p>If you need some screenshots or more in depth information, I found this post at <a href="https://www.linuxtechi.com/ubuntu-20-04-lts-installation-steps-screenshots/">Linux Techi</a> very informative.</p>
<p>What I’ve been struggling with was my additional HDD. During the Windows installation I formatted it as NTFS and mounted it in Windows but forgot to mount it permanently in Linux. When I used the HDD within Linux it was mounted without any problems, but it was mounted only when I explicitly used it. Therefore, paths to the folders changed slightly (e.g. my-storage/folder -&gt; my-storage1/folder) as the drive was newly mounted all the time. So I ended up with multiple paths in the end…</p>
<p>Luckily the solution was fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Applications/Utilities/Disks</li>
<li>Highlight your drive</li>
<li>Click the little gear wheels and click <em>Edit Mount Options</em></li>
<li>Make sure that the option <em>Mount at system startup</em> is checked</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively you could modify your ftab file directly to mount your drive at system startup.</p>
<p>I hope this post was informative. Feel free to contact me for any feedback :)</p>

<p>The call to build my own tower reached me quite late (still in my 20s though) as a tower PC wouldn’t have been very handy for me. And due to budget limitations not so much fun I guess :). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic I thought it would be fun to build my own PC and run some deep learning (DL) prototypes on it. Admittedly, I bought some games too…</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to explain how I built my PC and add some information and resources others might find helpful when building their own PC.</p>
<div id="choosing-your-parts" class="section level2">
<h2>Choosing your parts</h2>
<p>Choosing PC parts is the most time consuming but also the funniest part in my opinion. Still, it’s very critical because you can make the most mistakes.</p>
<p>First, be sure about what you really want to do with your PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you planning to use it for office tasks and/or gaming only?</li>
<li>Would you like to run some ML models?</li>
<li>How about editing some photos and videos?</li>
<li>Are you going to upgrade/extend parts when you have more budget?</li>
<li>Or do you just want to surf the internet and have some fancy tower with rgb lightning in your living room?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these use cases involve a different budget and some special components and/or operating systems. Speaking of budget, this might be the major limitation for your build and the main reason why you simply won’t be able to get the best all-in-one solution.</p>
<p>In my case I wanted to have a PC which can handle some deep learning model prototypes and some quality gaming fun. Luckily, most specifications are quite similar for both use cases, but could have some pitfalls as well. I’ll highlight them in the upcoming sections.</p>
<div id="central-processing-unit" class="section level3">
<h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
<p>For a decent gaming performance a CPU like the <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</strong> or <strong>Intel Core i7 9700K</strong> are sufficient. One of the later <strong>AMD Ryzen 5</strong> or <strong>Intel Core i5</strong> CPUs would do the job as well for less money. As the CPU only helps in batch scheduling and other small processes while the GPU is doing the actual model training, such a mid-range CPU should be fine for model prototyping. However, if you have GBs of data to preprocess and it fits in your budget, you might want to use the <strong>Intel Core i9 10980XE</strong> or the even more powerful <strong>AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="cpu-cooler" class="section level3">
<h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
<p>Though, I decided to stick to the Wraith Prism cooler, which ships with the AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, I should have invested in a quieter one (e.g. the Dark Rock Pro 4 or the Noctua NH-D15). But in terms of cooling, it gets the job done. However, if you’re thinking about using a more powerful CPU and/or more than two GPUs, you should look into an all in one water cooling system. Just make sure the cooler fits in your case and on the socket you have.</p>
</div>
<div id="motherboard" class="section level3">
<h3>Motherboard</h3>
<p>The mobo is more important than I thought before. There are a few points to consider when making your decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are different sizes available and might be limited to the size of your case.</li>
<li>The socket has to fit your CPU.</li>
<li>You’ll need multiple PCIe lanes if you want to have more than one GPU (as a GPU is quite wide you might need 4 lanes for 2 GPUs).</li>
<li>The number of DIMM slots for your RAM sticks.</li>
<li>The number of M2 slots for NVMe SSDs.</li>
<li>The SATA slots for SSDs or HDDs.</li>
<li>Any other slots you need (e.g. Thunderbolt, USB)</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you want to upgrade your build it might come handy in the future to have some additional slots in general.</p>
</div>
<div id="memory" class="section level3">
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>It might not be necessary to have more than 8-16 GB of RAM for gaming or smaller data-sets. But this also depends on your usage. As stated above, if you do a lot of preprocessing more RAM would help to increase speed. Still, there are a few important things to mention here. Make sure the RAM is supported by your motherboard. If you use more than one RAM stick don’t mix clock speeds. Stick to one type. And check your manual for the RAM installation, especially if you have multiple DIMM slots for your RAM.</p>
</div>
<div id="storage" class="section level3">
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Storage could be quite expensive and frustrating. Therefore, evaluate what’s important for you. You have the choice between <strong>HDD</strong>, <strong>SSD</strong>, and <strong>NVMe SSD</strong>.</p>
<p>The old <strong>HDD</strong> is a mechanical solution with a rotating magnetic disc with a brush for reading and writing bits on it. It’s comparably slow, large and sensitive to damage and corruption by external influences. But they are durable and much less expensive than the other options.</p>
<p><strong>SSDs</strong> are much faster than HDDs. They are safer as they don’t have any mechanical or moving parts.</p>
<p><strong>NVMe SSDs</strong> (Non-Volatile Memory Express) are the fastest option, but also the most expensive one. While regular SSDs have the bottleneck with their SATA 3 slots giving a max transfer of 600 Mbps, NVMe SSDs rely on PCIe with 2-3 GB/s. However, you have to check if your mobo has enough M2 slots and your storage is compatible with your mobo (check out the compatible components on the website of your mobo’s manufacturer).</p>
<p>For me a combination of 2 NVMe SSDs and a 1 TB HDD was a good combination. I installed the OS on the SSDs (one Windows the other Linux) and use the HDD for data storage (older games, large data-sets). So I always have the option to increase speed and use the SSD if needed for training or gaming.</p>
</div>
<div id="graphics-processing-unit" class="section level3">
<h3>Graphics Processing Unit</h3>
<p>GPUs would need much more detail than I can give here (see <a href="https://timdettmers.com/2019/04/03/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/">Tim Dettmers</a>’s blog for details). Therefore, I just briefly outline my experience.</p>
<p>I first thought about how many GPUs I should by. Reality hit me rather quick, though. First, it’s a very expensive part and second, I wouldn’t really need that many GPU power for what I plan to use my PC for. What is more, if I should find myself in the unlikely situation of running short of GPU power, there are still cloud services which scale nicely.</p>
<p>In terms of NVIDIA vs. AMD I choose NVIDIA simply because deep learning libraries support the NVIDIA environment better.</p>
</div>
<div id="case" class="section level3">
<h3>Case</h3>
<p>The decision of which case is best highly depends on your taste. However, it was helpful for me to consider some points when making my decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobo size: Make sure your mobo fits in your case (could be quite annoying otherwise).</li>
<li>PSU fit: Although, you wouldn’t have any troubles most of the time, some special or rare cases might require a certain PSU.</li>
<li>Airflow vs. Quiet: Not all cases with good airflow are quiet and not all quiet cases have a good airflow. Although the difference seems to be rather small and with a few extra thoughts about cooling and cable management, neither option should negatively influence the performance. Additionally, be sure that your idea of cooling works out with your desired case (e.g. enough space for fans, radiators or the CPU cooler height).</li>
<li>Convenience:
<ul>
<li>Make sure to have audio jacks, USB, Thunderbolt, etc. slots available if you want them.</li>
<li>Cable management can be very different. Watch some of the videos about case assembling first to get an idea about what’s important (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvWWf-LYjaujE50iYai8WgQ">Pauls’s Hardware</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCftcLVz-jtPXoH3cWUUDwYw">Bitwit</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from that you might need some cable extensions, but you definitely need some zipping for a nice cable management.</p>
</div>
<div id="power-supply-unit" class="section level3">
<h3>Power Supply Unit</h3>
<p>Obviously, having enough watts for your build is important. To make sure to have enough power, check the specifications of your components on their manufacturer’s website. Simply sum up their power consumption and add about a 10% extra (e.g. your components need 650 watts go for a PSU which supplies at least 715 watts so you could round up to 750.). As a PSU should last rather long, while other components might get replaced, it could be a good idea to invest in a more powerful PSU. So you could upgrade your PC without buying a new PSU. Finally, in case you have multiple GPUs in your build, check if your PSU has enough PCIe 8-pin or 6-pin connectors to supply them with the power they need.</p>
</div>
<div id="assembling" class="section level3">
<h3>Assembling</h3>
<p>The major advice I can give as a first time builder: Plan enough time. Although, it looks easy and fast in the tutorials, you wouldn’t be able to build your PC in an hour without prior knowledge. Additionally, pay attention on how to handle your components (e.g. avoid static loading) and on cable management. Cable management could make a huge difference for your PCs performance as it might influence airflow and cause overheating components.</p>
<p>Apart from that, I hope this post was a bit helpful for building your own first PC. Feel free to contact me for any feedback :)</p>
