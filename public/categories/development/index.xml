      <description>TL;DR
This post is meant to be a little cheat sheet for Docker setup and usage. Docker is a great tool to containerize your software products, which makes your products portable and usable in several areas (e.g.Â cloud or on-premises). Additionally, it is a great playground for developers as containers can offer a secure environment to try out something new without risking to break something. Furthermore, they scale nicely and are therefore rather resource-efficient.</description>
